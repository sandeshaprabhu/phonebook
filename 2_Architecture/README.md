## This folder contains the architecture of the phonebook program with its flow charts.  
The phonebook program is divided into two parts. First part contains the main function to choose the operation to be performed on the phonebook. Second part contains all the definitions of operations performed on phonebook.  
In the program, the user enters the choice and it’s further processed using the switch case. Then control takes to the particular case and executes the corresponding function to it.  
If the choice is entered beyond 6, then it prompts the user to enter the choice again. If choice 6 is chosen then it exits the program.
